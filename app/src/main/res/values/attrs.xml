<!-- Define attributes for three fan colors. Define the name and format of your custom attributes in a
<declare-styleable> resource element. The format is like a type, and in this case, it's a color. The
code declares a styleable called DialView. The name is, by convention, the same name as the name of
the class that defines the custom view (in this case, DialView). Although it's not strictly necessary
to follow this convention, many popular code editors depend on this naming convention to provide
statement completion.-->

    <declare-styleable name="DialView">
